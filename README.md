This is a React component that allows users to edit and add fields for 4 data types String, Number, Boolean and Object.

The user can add new fields, update existing ones and also delete them.

We have used 3rd party library react-uuid to generate unique ids for list items (in order to identify which one to delete/update as index of map function will not serve as unique id in this case)

We have used Material UI to implement Switch component (for required field)
